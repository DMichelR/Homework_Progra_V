    2. Parenthesise the following numeric expressions:
        2^3*4
        2*3+4*5
        2+3*4^5
    ANSWER:
        (2^3)*4
        (2*3)+(4*5)
        2+(3*(4^5))

    3. The script below contains three syntactic errors. Correct these errors and then check that your
    script works properly using GHCi.
        N = a ’div’ length xs
        where
            a = 10
            xs = [1,2,3,4,5]
    ANSWER:
        n = a `div` length xs
        where
            a = 10
            xs = [1,2,3,4,5]

    4. The library function last selects the last element of a non-empty list; for example, last
    [1,2,3,4,5] = 5. Show how the function last could be defined in terms of the other library
    functions introduced in this chapter. Can you think of another possible definition?
        last' :: [a] -> a
        last' xs = head (reverse xs)


    5. The library function init removes the last element from a non-empty list; for example, init
    [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4]. Show how init could similarly be defined in two different ways.

        -- Method 1: Using `take` and `length`
        init' :: [a] -> [a]
        init' xs = take (length xs - 1) xs
 
        -- Method 2: Using list comprehension
        init'' :: [a] -> [a]
        init'' xs = [xs !! i | i <- [0..length xs - 2]]
